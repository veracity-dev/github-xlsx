is a proposal for having end user documentation within Storybook itself- to be considered with #603 (landing page) and #617 (live examples).\r\n\r\nThe initial commit contains a **draft** of the \"Timeseries\" page.\r\n\r\nPreview [here](https://pr-620.gearboxjs.preview.cogniteapp.com/?path=/story/docs-using-timeseries--page)\r\n\r\n\"Timeseries\" page is divided into three sections:\r\n\r\n1. **API** - a narrative of using the JS SDK to access time series \r\n2. **Components** - a narrative of using Gearbox components to visualize time series\r\n3. **Internals** - how the Gearbox components related to time series work internally (there's some notes/sketches on this which I can commit as the discussion progresses)\r\n\r\nOther suggested pages, in the order they make sense:\r\n\r\n- About - this is done under PR #603 (landing page) - preview [here](https://pr-603.gearboxjs.preview.cogniteapp.com/?path=/story/docs-about--page)\r\n- Assets\r\n- Timeseries - this draft PR\r\n- Events\r\n- 3D Models\r\n- 2D Models\r\n\r\nCurrently the code examples are given as code highlighted static text. But since the whole thing is inside a `.mdx` file, we can make the examples live- `App` is already imported from PR #617, so we can:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<App>\r\n{\r\n  // Access the AppContext and get a live CogniteClient instance, \r\n  //  then use it with Gearbox components\r\n}\r\n</App>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why**: Currently information at this level of detail (_API > Data Structures > Components > Usage Patterns_) for use by developers using the JS SDK and Gearbox library to build web apps against the CDF platform does not exist either at the [developer doc site](https://docs.cognite.com/dev/) or at the [learning portal](https://learn.cognite.com/catalog/index).

But when developing/fixing Gearbox components, we often need to work with live data. Currently, Gearbox developers temporarily modify the stories to work against a live `CogniteClient` instance when needed. These modifications are not committed. This PR improves on this by providing the scaffolding to experiment/test with live data.\r\n- Storybook examples are very basic- each story's intent is to illustrate one aspect of a component.  On the other hand, the intent of one of these examples is to illustrate more concrete use cases- often involving multiple interacting components.\r\n\r\n#### An Example\r\n\r\nThe `src/examples/Sandbox`:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { useContext } from 'react';\r\nimport { AssetTree } from '../components/AssetTree';\r\nimport { ClientSDKProvider } from '../components/ClientSDKProvider';\r\nimport { AppContext } from './app/App';\r\n\r\nexport Sandbox = () => {\r\n  const ctx = useContext(AppContext);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <ClientSDKProvider client={ctx!.client!}>\r\n      <AssetTree />\r\n    </ClientSDKProvider>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### The AppContext\r\n\r\nThe `AppContext` is in the shape of:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n{\r\n  client: CogniteClient | null;\r\n  project: string;\r\n  loggedIn: boolean;\r\n  onLogin: (arg0: LoginFormParams) => void;\r\n  onLogout: () => void;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe stories in `src/examples/Examples.story.mdx` are all decorated with the `App` component which provides the `AppContext` to its descendants.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Meta title=\"Docs/Examples\" decorators={[storyFn => <App>{storyFn()}</App>]} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `AppContext` is resoponsible for managing the \"Application aspects\" on behalf of all the examples; such as login-in to the CDF using a `CogniteClient` instance.\r\n\r\nThe `Menu` component uses the `AppContext` to provide the user info and sign-out button.\r\n\r\n#### Authentication\r\n\r\nWhen mounted, the `App` component checks if user credentials (`project` and `token`) are stored in the local storage and initialises a `CogniteClient` instance and renders its children. If the credentials are not saved, it displays the login screen. This works very nicely with Storybook's hot reloading.\r\n\r\n#### Analyse Timeseries Example\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2020-01-27 at 15 51

possibly have more examples like \"Browse Assets\",  \"Explore in 3D\", and \"Infographics\".","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/gearbox.js/issues/605","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/gearbox.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/gearbox.js/issues/605/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/gearbox.js/issues/605/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/gearbox.js/issues/605/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cognitedata/gearbox.js/issues/605","id":552153106,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NTIxNTMxMDY=","number":605,"title":"Revise

component\r\n\r\n#### Previous pattern:\r\n\r\nAll Gearbox components that interact with the Cognite API does so via a `CogniteClient` object. This object is provided via React's context mechanism.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ntype ClientSDKContextType = CogniteClient | null;\r\n\r\nclass AcmeWidget extends React.Component<AcmeWidgetProps, AcmeWidgetState> {\r\n  static contextType = ClientSDKContext;\r\n  context!: React.ContextType<typeof ClientSDKContext>;\r\n\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    if (!this.context) {\r\n      console.error(ERROR_NO_SDK_CLIENT);\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInside some components, fields of the `CogniteClient` object- which corresponds to various APIs exposed by CDF, are bound to class fields of the component in `componentDidMount`\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { FooAPI } from '@cognite/sdk/dist/src/resources/foo/fooApi';\r\n\r\nclass AcmeWidget extends React.Component<AcmeWidgetProps, AcmeWidgetState> {\r\n  fooApi!: FooAPI;\r\n\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    this.fooApi = this.context.foo;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### New pattern\r\n\r\nInstead of being a `CogniteClient` object, the context is now a function. When called with a single string argument- the component display name for usage logs,  this function returns the actual `CogniteClient` object.\r\n\r\nSo the static `contextType` property should be set to  `ClientSDKProxyContext` instead of `ClientSDKContext` \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { ClientSDKProxyContext } from '../../context/clientSDKProxyContext';\r\n// import { ClientSDKContext } from '../../context/clientSDKContext';\r\n\r\nclass AcmeWidget extends React.Component<AcmeWidgetProps, AcmeWidgetState> {\r\n  static contextType = ClientSDKProxyContext;\r\n  context!: React.ContextType<typeof ClientSDKProxyContext>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen a new class field- `client`, is defined to hold a reference to the `CogniteClient` object. This is assigned in `componentDidMount` and used inside the component instead of `context` (which earlier held the reference to the `CogniteClient` object)\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass AcmeWidget extends React.Component<AcmeWidgetProps, AcmeWidgetState> {  \r\n  static displayName = 'AcmeWidget';\r\n  \r\n  client!: CogniteClient;\r\n\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    this.client = this.context(AcmeWidget.displayName || '')!;\r\n    if (!this.client) {\r\n      console.error(ERROR_NO_SDK_CLIENT);\r\n      return;\r\n   \t}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the component is wrapped in another component  before being exported. In these cases, the `displayName` prop is set in the outermost component before exporting. \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass AcmeWidget extends React.Component<AcmeWidgetProps, AcmeWidgetState> {  \r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    this.client = this.context(Component.displayName || '')!;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst Component = someDecorators(AcmeWidget);\r\n\r\nComponent.displayName = 'AcmeWidget';\r\nexport { Component as AcmeWidget };\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `withFoo` style higher order components, instead of `Component.displayName` or `AcmeWidget.displayName`, `WrapperComponent.displayName` is used.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { ClientSDKProxyContext } from '../context/clientSDKProxyContext';\r\n\r\nexport const withFoo = <P extends WithFooDataProps>(\r\n  WrapperComponent: React.ComponentType<P>\r\n) =>\r\n  class\r\n    extends React.Component<\r\n      Subtract<P, WithFootDataProps> & WithFooProps,\r\n      WithFooState\r\n    > implements ComponentWithUnmountState \r\n{\r\n      \r\n    static contextType = ClientSDKProxyContext;\r\n    context!: React.ContextType<typeof ClientSDKProxyContext>;\r\n    client!: CogniteClient;\r\n\r\n    componentDidMount() {\r\n      this.client = this.context(WrapperComponent.displayName || '')!;\r\n      if (!this.client) {\r\n        console.error(ERROR_NO_SDK_CLIENT);\r\n        return;\r\n      }\r\n      this.loadAsset();\r\n    }\r\n      \r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn functional components (e.g. `TimeseriesPreview`, `AssetBreadcrumb`)\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst AcmeWidget: React.FC<AcmeWidgetProps> = ({\r\n  // ...\r\n  const context = useCogniteContext(Component, true);\r\n\r\n\tuseEffect(() => {\r\n    const fetcherFn = async () => {\r\n      const data = await context!.api3.op4();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    fetcherFn();\r\n  });\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor functional components that use the cached client:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// Refer 5a10057\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor class components that use the cached client:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { ClientSDKProxyContext } from '../../context/clientSDKProxyContext';\r\n\r\nclass AcmeWidget extends React.Component<AcmeWidgetProps, AcmeWidgetState> {  \r\n  static displayName = 'AcmeWidget';\r\n  static contextType = ClientSDKProxyContext;\r\n  \r\n  client!: CogniteClient;\r\n  context: React.ContextType<typeof ClientSDKProxyContext>\r\n  \r\n  constructor(\r\n    props: AcmeWidgetProps,\r\n    context: React.ContextType<typeof ClientSDKProxyContext>\r\n  ) {\r\n    \r\n    if (!context) {\r\n      console.error(ERROR_NO_SDK_CLIENT);\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n    this.client = context(AcmeWidget.displayName || '')!;\r\n    \r\n    interactWithTheApi(this.client);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/gearbox.js/issues/538","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/gearbox.js","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/gearbox.js/issues/538/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/gearbox.js/issues/538/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/gearbox.js/issues/538/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cognitedata/gearbox.js/pull/538","id":534781298,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzUwNTk0MzMy","number":538,"title":"feat(3d

embedded Griff `LineChart` component. \r\n\r\n**Change**: Inspired by the implementation in OpInt, this PR disables the ruler in Griff's `LineChart` component and implements an internal overlay component called `CursorOverview` to display the `yLabel` and `timeLabel`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"771\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-11-22 at 13 00 04\"

points under the ruler\r\n- `yLabel` is an optional callback for formatting the \"value of each ruler point\" - this gets called once for each point under the ruler\r\n\r\nThe type of the `ruler` prop is `ChartRulerConfig` - this interface is compatible with what was used previously:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface ChartRulerConfig {\r\n  visible?: boolean;\r\n  timeLabel?: (point:

labelHeight: number;\r\n      timeLabelMargin: number;\r\n    }\r\n  ) => number;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface ChartRulerPoint {\r\n  id: number | string;\r\n  name: string;\r\n  value: number | string;\r\n  color: string;\r\n  timestamp: number;\r\n  x: number;\r\n  y: number;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiving an empty object for `ruler` prop uses the built-in timeLabel and yLabel callbacks.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/javascript-getting-started/issues/62","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/javascript-getting-started","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/javascript-getting-started/issues/62/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/javascript-getting-started/issues/62/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cognitedata/javascript-getting-started/issues/62/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cognitedata/javascript-getting-started/pull/62","id":494685913,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzE4MzkwMzY5","number":62,"title":"Intro
